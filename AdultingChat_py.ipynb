In the beginning of the chat, the user shall indicate the intention whether they are seeking to open a bank account or get a valid ID. The response of the bot will depend on the user selection. After this, the user will indicate what type of ID or which bank they are interested. Based on the selection, the bot can give answers on general information, process overview, eligibility, validity, and requirements."

Log in using your User ID and password.\\n1.1.3. Hover over Member Info on the main menu and click Appointment System.\\n1.1.4. Select the purpose of your appointment (i.e., UMID Card Application).\\n1.1.5.

Select your preferred schedule and the available counter number to process your application. Also, enter your specific concern as “New UMID application” in the box provided.\\n1.1.7. Print or take a screenshot of your transaction details as shown on the screen. You will also receive an email notification containing the exact transaction details.\\n1.2. Branch Walk-in (Manual Application)\\n1.2.1. Members who aren’t internet-savvy and haven’t created a My.SSS accounts yet can also walk into the nearest SSS branch and file their UMID card applications even without an online appointment. However, remember that you can’t just go to the SSS branch any time of the week as SSS branches now implement the Branch Number Coding System.\\n1.2.2. Based on this system, the 10th digit of your SS or Employer (ER) ID number determines your prescribed transaction day. The prescribed transaction day assigned to each number is as follows:\\n1.2.2.a. 1 and 2: Monday\\n1.2.2.b. 3 and 4: Tuesday\\n1.2.2.c. 5 and 6: Wednesday\\n1.2.2.d. 7 and 8: Thursday\\n1.2.2.e. 9 and 10: Friday\\n\\n2.

The SSS staff will verify your documents and information with the SSS database.\\n\\n3. Have your biometrics taken\\n3.1. Go to the ID and Biometric capture booth, where your photo, fingerprints, and digital signature will be taken.\\n3.2. The personnel will let you view on a computer screen what your actual UMID looks like. Double-check your details, mainly your name, birth date, and address. Tell the staff if you spot an error to have it corrected immediately.\\n\\n4. Wait for a notification From SSS on when you can pick up your UMID Card\\n4.1. Even though UMID card applications have resumed as of October 15, 2021, SSS informs all members to expect delays in the production of UMID cards as they’re dealing with many backlogs brought about by the pandemic. Priority will be given to UMID card applications filed in 2020 (and earlier) before the temporary suspension was implemented. Rest assured, members will receive notifications once their cards become available for pick-up.\\n\\n5. Activate Your UMID Card\\n5.1. Once you receive your UMID card, activate it using the SSS kiosk at the nearest SSS branch. After activation, members can easily withdraw their benefits and loan proceeds from any Bancnet ATM nationwide or Visa-branded ATMs for international transactions.\\n\\nSource: FilipiKnow.net on How To Get UMID ID 2024: Step-by-Step Guide\\n'},\n",

This report lists all the classes you took, the tests you passed, and the points you earned.

When sending the report online, you can explain the grading scale used during your study. This explanation should make clear which grades are the best and worst. Your school records can be filled out by you, your home school, or the foreign school’s office, depending on their rules.

Online Appointment System (Online Application; This only applies if you already have your own My.SSS account)\\n1.1.1. Go to the official SSS website and select the Member portal.\\n1.1.2. Log in using your User ID and password.\\n1.1.3. Hover over Member Info on the main menu and click Appointment System.\\n1.1.4. Select the purpose of your appointment (i.e., UMID Card Application).\\n1.1.5. Select your region, preferred SSS servicing branch, and appointment date (Note that red dates are unavailable while those marked green still have remaining slots left).\\n1.1.6. Select your preferred schedule and the available counter number to process your application. Also, enter your specific concern as “New UMID application” in the box provided.\\n1.1.7. Print or take a screenshot of your transaction details as shown on the screen. You will also receive an email notification containing the exact transaction details.\\n1.2. Branch Walk-in (Manual Application)\\n1.2.1. Members who aren’t internet-savvy and haven’t created a My.SSS accounts yet can also walk into the nearest SSS branch and file their UMID card applications even without an online appointment. However, remember that you can’t just go to the SSS branch any time of the week as SSS branches now implement the Branch Number Coding System.\\n1.2.2. Based on this system, the 10th digit of your SS or Employer (ER) ID number determines your prescribed transaction day. The prescribed transaction day assigned to each number is as follows:\\n1.2.2.a. 1 and 2: Monday\\n1.2.2.b. 3 and 4: Tuesday\\n1.2.2.c. 5 and 6: Wednesday\\n1.2.2.d. 7 and 8: Thursday\\n1.2.2.e. 9 and 10: Friday\\n\\n2. Submit your SSS UMID requirements to the staff.\\n2.1. Proceed to the SSS branch on the date of your appointment or the prescribed day of the transaction.\\n2.2. Get the queue number and wait for your turn. Once your number is called, submit the duly accomplished UMID card application form and copies of your valid ID/s. The SSS staff will verify your documents and information with the SSS database.\\n\\n3. Have your biometrics taken\\n3.1. Go to the ID and Biometric capture booth, where your photo, fingerprints, and digital signature will be taken.\\n3.2. The personnel will let you view on a computer screen what your actual UMID looks like. Double-check your details, mainly your name, birth date, and address. Tell the staff if you spot an error to have it corrected immediately.\\n\\n4. Wait for a notification From SSS on when you can pick up your UMID Card\\n4.1. Even though UMID card applications have resumed as of October 15, 2021, SSS informs all members to expect delays in the production of UMID cards as they’re dealing with many backlogs brought about by the pandemic.
